Payments are made on your utility bill. While OnBill financing has been around for many years, only recently has the application process been simplified enough for small businesses to take advantage. OnBill programs vary widely by state and utility provider. In some states, OnBill may only be used for very small projects and the property owner must pay an interest rate. In other states, there may be zero interest. In almost all cases, the property owner is required to have good credit to qualify.
