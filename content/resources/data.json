You repay funds to private lenders as a semi-annual voluntary tax, the first voluntary property tax assessment in the U.S. By using voluntary property taxes to repay funds, you and other small businesses get access to the same financing terms that large corporations benefit from, ensuring that your projects produce positive cash flow in year 1. This frees you up to spend your capital on other investment opportunities, such as opening that next location or hiring more staff.</p>",

OnBill programs vary widely by state and utility provider. In some states, OnBill may only be used for very small projects and the property owner must pay an interest rate. In other states, there may be zero interest. In almost all cases, the property owner is required to have good credit to qualify.
